### Clib

League of Legends login helper

### About

Clib has an automatic and manual way of logging in, both launching the League Client Update in the process and handling how Clib should close.

#### Automatic

Your password is entered directly into League, avoiding saving your password to the clipboard. When using this method, it is recommended to use a unique password in case it is accidentally pasted somewhere else.

#### Manual

Nothing fancy here, just your password being copied to the clipboard where you can then paste it into League via `Ctrl+V`. This method is arguably more secure, especially considering Clib will clear your clipboard after 25 seconds.
