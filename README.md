### Clib

League of Legends Login Helper

### About

Create a seamless login experience when League is launched and your password is copied to the clipboard to paste via `Ctrl+V`. Clib then closes after 20 seconds and your clipboard clears.

Clib beta release now has a more advanced system that includes automatically entering your password into the League client and completes the process for you.

### Disclaimer
> Neither Clib or mellow are associated with League of Legends or Riot Games. No information is collected by Clib. Any data entered into Clib is only saved on the user's local device.

> Clib does NOT know your username. If using the auto-paste feature (beta only) it is recommended to use a password unique for League in case it is accidentally pasted somewhere else! Again, this is a beta feature!
